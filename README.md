ArduFloppy
==========
Interfacing with a floppy drive on Arduino

This is an attempt to read/write data on a floppy disk using Arduino. It's impossible (or nearly impossible) to read standard PC formatted floppies using Arduino because it's way too slow, but you can read your own data written at a slower rate. The code is far from perfect and has a lot of data loss, but you can at least see it's working.

Made on Arduino MEGA 2560 with some random floppy drive from and old computer.
